# Hackpad

A 10-key macropad with a diagnostic LED for debugging. It's based on a Seeed XIAO RP2040.

# PCB

This is my PCB. I made it using KiCAD. It is 60x85mm and uses 2 layers with no vias.

# Enclosure

I designed the enclosure using OnShape (Fusion was completely broken at the time).

The PCB is held in with two M3 standoffs.

The bottom of the case has been countersunk for the bolt-heads.
